Disengaged stakeholders,"For the purpose of this excercise - let imagine I am developing a piece of software for a group of companies. The customers, myself, bar staff and companies using the product are the stakeholders. The customers and the bar staff may not like the new system, they may find it hard to put the bottle back in the same place and the customers - at the bar - may find service slow and get annoyed. Myself, the developer will be constantly trying to improve the product to make it faster and easier to use. The companies that are paying for the procduct will be the most important stakeholder because they are the ones paying for the product. They will like the fact the data is there in real time but they may have H&S requirements they have to stick to so before the product is put into production there needs to be tests carreid out on whether the scale pass these requirements.",low,high,Jake Stone,Design software and then test the product,Null,Good ,High
